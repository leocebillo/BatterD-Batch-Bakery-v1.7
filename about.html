    <h2>Hardwork, dedication, and fun</h2>

    <p>
      Batter'd Batch Bakery started with a simple conversation
      between Cate and Leo. Cate spoke about previously baking
      cupcakes and cakes, and Leo suggested starting a business
      for it. From there, Batter'd Batch Bakery was born. with
      Cate baking delicious treats from her home kitchen, and
      Leo managing the administrative side of things. The two
      worked hard to ensure a smooth start to the business,
      focusing on quality, care, and friendly service.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every order is made fresh in batches of 6 or 12, using quality ingredients
      and thoughtful detail. From classic flavors to custom cupcakes and cakes--
      each treat is baked with love and care. Oppurtunities for cusstom orders
      will fall soon, so stay tuned!
    </p>

    <p>
      As a home-based bakery, we focus on ensuring our creations
      are good quality, made with care, and delivered with a smile.
      From our home-made website, to our cupcakes and cakes, everything
      is made with that special touch of love.
